Bleeding edge: *do not use*!...

My draft attempts at a programmatic way of grabbing trait data from
the Internet. Emphatically *not* a trait database; that you can
download data using this repository does not mean you should (indeed,
using data from these sources without contacting their authors would
be contrary to their wishes).
